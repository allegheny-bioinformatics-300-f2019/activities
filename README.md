Designed for use with [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/), this repository contains the files for class actities for CS300.


## Learning

If you have not done so already, please read all of the relevant [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/) that explain how to use many of the features that GitHub provides. In particular, please make sure that you have read the following GitHub guides: [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), [Hello World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/), and [Documenting Your Projects on GitHub](https://guides.github.com/features/wikis/). Each of these guides will help you to understand how to use both [GitHub](http://github.com) and [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/).

To do well on this assignment, you should also review the chapters of the course textbook and the relevant course slides. Please see the course instructor or one of the teaching assistants or tutors if you have questions about any of these reading assignments.

## Updates

When the course instructor provides the new material for the in-class activity, you can type this command in the main directory for this repository:

```
git remote add download git@github.com:allegheny-bioinformatics-300-f2019/activities
```

You should only need to type this command once; typing the command additional
times may yield an error message but will not negatively influence the state of your repository. Now, you are ready to download the updates provided by the
course instructor by typing:

```
git pull download master
```

This second command can be run whenever the course instructor needs to provide
you with new source code for this assignment. However, please note that, if you
have edited the files that the course instructor updated, running the previous
command may lead to Git merge conflicts. If this happens, you may need to
manually resolve them with the help of the instructor or a teaching assistant.

## Assistance

If you are having trouble completing any part of these project, then please talk with either the course instructor or a teaching assistant during the practical session. Alternatively, you may ask questions in the Slack team for this course. Finally, you can schedule a meeting during the course instructor's office hours.
